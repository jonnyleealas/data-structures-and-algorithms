# Linked List

## Challenge Description 
Write methods for a Linked List
1. Method **insert** add argument to the head of a list.
1. Method **includes** should return a boolean result depending on weather a value exists.
1. Method **toString** which returns a string representing all the values in the linked list.
1. Method **append** which allows user to add a given value to the end of a list.
1. Method **insertBefore** which allows a user to add a new value before a pre-existing value.
1. Method **insertAfter** which adds a new node value after a value node.
1. Method **kthFromEnd** Return node (k) from the end of a linked list.
1. Method **zip()** Combines two linked list into one alternating list.

## Approach and Efficiency 
- insert() O(1)
- includes() O(n)
- toString() O(n)
- append() O(n)
- insertBefore() O(n)
- insertAfter() O(n)
- kthFromEnd() O(n)
- zip() O(n)

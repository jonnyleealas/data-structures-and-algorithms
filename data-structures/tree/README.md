# Trees
Creating Classes for traversal or Trees and Binary Trees

## Challenge
Create a class for Node, BinaryTree, BinarySearchTree
```
- [x] method add()
- [x] method contains()
- [x] method preorder()
- [x] method inOrder()
- [x] method postOrder()
- [ ] method breadthFirst()

```

## Approach & Efficiency
```
O(h) and O(1)
```

## Testing
```
Testing is run using jest through github actions
```

# Challenge Summary
PROBLEM DOMAIN: BreadthFirst()
```
Given a binary search tree return a list of values in the tree in the order they were encountered
input: Binary Search Tree
output: List of values in order
```

## Challenge Description
```
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
```


## Approach & Efficiency
```
O(h) and O(1)

# Hashtables
Create a hashtable class with the methods below.

## Challenge Create Methods
- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
Worst Case O(n)
Best Case O(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->

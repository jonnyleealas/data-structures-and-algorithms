# Stacks and Queues
Create a class for Stack and class for Queue with methods for adding, removing, and viewing a stack and a queue.

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has value stored in Node and pointer to next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
- Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
-Should raise exception when called on empty stack
- Define a method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O for methods will be O(1)

## Description Of Methods
### Stack
- Push: Takes any value and add a node with that value on the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes node from top of stack. Does not take arguments.
- Peek: Returns value of top node in a stack.
- isEmpty: Returns a boolean indicating whether a stack is empty.

### Queue
- enqueue: Take an argument and adds a new node to the back of a queue.
- dequeue: Removes a node from the front of a queue and returns nodes value.
 Peek: Returns value of the node in the front a the queue without removing from queue. Should raise exception when called on empty queue.
 - isEmpty: Returns boolean indicating whether or not a queue is empty.
